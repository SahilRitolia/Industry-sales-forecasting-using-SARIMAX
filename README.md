This project aims to develop a robust time series forecasting solution for sales data using the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX) model. The SARIMAX model is a powerful statistical technique for analyzing and forecasting univariate time series data with seasonal patterns and external factors influencing the target variable.
Features

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outlier detection, and data transformations to prepare the sales data for time series modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducts comprehensive exploratory data analysis, including visualizations, trend analysis, and stationarity tests, to gain insights into the sales data and identify potential seasonality patterns.
SARIMAX Model Training: Implements the SARIMAX model training process, involving order selection (p, d, q, P, D, Q) through techniques like ACF/PACF plots, parameter estimation using maximum likelihood, and diagnostic checks for residual analysis.
Exogenous Variable Integration: Incorporates relevant exogenous variables, such as promotions, holidays, or economic indicators, into the SARIMAX model to improve forecasting accuracy.
Forecast Generation: Generates point forecasts and prediction intervals for future sales values over a specified time horizon.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the performance of the SARIMAX model using various metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
Backtesting and Cross-Validation: Implements backtesting and cross-validation techniques to assess the robustness and generalization capabilities of the SARIMAX model.
Visualization and Reporting: Generates intuitive visualizations and reports to communicate forecasting results, model diagnostics, and performance metrics to stakeholders.
